nRF52 Cowboy e-bike remote control fob
====


This is a work in progress, the code is terrible, but it does work on the nRF52-DK.


There is also the first esp32 sample from arduino IDE, that's how I got started.

Submit an issue if you need some pointers to get it to work, but I give 0 guarantees or warranty.
